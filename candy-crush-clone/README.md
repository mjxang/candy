Short Summary
At first, I struggled to decide what to make for this lab because I’m still figuring out what I want to do in the future. After spending a lot of time searching and overthinking, I had a moment of clarity while watching my mom play Candy Crush on the couch—something she genuinely enjoys and finds comfort in. That moment reminded me that even if I don’t have a clear career path yet, I know I want to create things that bring people happiness, especially the people I love. So, I decided to make a Candy Crush clone as a tribute to that feeling.

For this project, I used React, Redux Toolkit with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript to handle the front-end logic, styling, and state management. This ties into the MERN stack we’ve been working with in class, particularly the React component, as I applied many of the concepts we learned like reusable components, event handling, and managing state—only this time at a larger scale and using Redux to handle game state more cleanly.

While this isn’t a full-stack project, building this front-end game helped me better understand the React layer of MERN and gave me insight into how frontend logic can be structured and scaled. It was fun, challenging, and meaningful to me, and I’m proud of how it turned out.
